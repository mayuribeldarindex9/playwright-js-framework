## Overview

This Playwright automation framework is designed for end-to-end testing of web applications using JavaScript/TypeScript.  
It provides a structured setup with organized test files, configuration, and reusable components, enabling efficient, scalable, and maintainable test automation.  

The framework supports:

- Multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Parallel test execution
- Data-driven tests
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Rich reporting & debugging tools

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control
- Recommended: VS Code or your preferred IDE

---

## Setup & Installation ,Onboarding Instructions
 
1. Clone the repository:

 
 
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/playwright-js-framework.git
   cd playwright-js-framework
````


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install // use this command to install all dependencies from package.json
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:



   npx playwright install // use this command after you installed all dependencies from package.json 
   ```

4. Create `.env` file by copying example and add your environment variables:



   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. (Optional) Install pre-commit hooks if configured:



   npm run prepare
   ```

6. Run tests:
npm run test       # run all tests headless
npm run test:headed # run tests with browser UI visible
npm run test:report # generate + open HTML report

---

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test  // to run the automation test case
```

Run tests with detailed logging and debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

Run tests in a specific file or folder:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts
```

Run tests in parallel (default is number of CPU cores):

```bash
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

Run tests with specific tags/grep:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

---

## Writing Tests

* Use the Playwright Test API (`test`, `expect`) for creating tests.
* Prefer the Page Object Model (POM) to encapsulate selectors and actions.
* Write small, atomic, independent tests.

Example test:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example Domain/);
});
```

---

## Configuration & Environment Variables

* Configure global settings such as base URL, timeouts, browsers in `playwright.config.ts`.
* Use `.env` files for environment-specific variables (API keys, URLs, credentials).
* Never commit sensitive credentials to Git.

---

## Linting & Formatting

* The project uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.

* Run lint checks manually:


  npm run lint
  ```

* Auto-fix issues:


  npm run lint:fix
  ```

---

## CI/CD Integration

* GitHub Actions workflow is pre-configured in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`.
* It runs tests on pushes and pull requests.
* Adjust workflows for your CI provider as needed (Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitLab, etc.)

---

## Debugging Tests

* Use:



  npx playwright test --debug
  ```

* Add `.only` to run a single test.

* Capture screenshots/videos on failure with configuration in `playwright.config.ts`.

---

## Reporting

* Generate HTML reports after tests:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --reporter=html
  ```

* View report at `playwright-report/index.html`.

## Allure Reporting Integration

## Allure provides comprehensive, interactive test reports with detailed steps, screenshots, and attachments.

Installation:
npm install --save-dev allure-playwright allure-commandline
Usage:

Run tests with Allure reporter:


npm run test:allure
Generate Allure HTML report:

npm run allure:generate
Open Allure report in browser:


npm run allure:open
Output folders:

allure-results/ — Raw test results
allure-report/ — Generated HTML report

Recommended npm scripts (add to package.json):

"scripts": {
  "test:allure": "npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright",
  "allure:generate": "allure generate allure-results --clean",
  "allure:open": "allure open allure-report",
  "clean:results": "rimraf allure-results playwright-report"
}
---

## Parallel Execution

* Tests run in parallel by default.
* Customize workers count via CLI or config (`workers` option).

---

## Test Tagging & Filtering

* Tag tests using annotations or by naming conventions.
* Run filtered tests using `--grep` or `.only`.

---

## Browser and Device Emulation

* Test across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.
* Emulate mobile devices with Playwright device descriptors.

---

## Data-Driven Testing

* Store test data in `data/` folder.
* Load and iterate data sets in your tests.

---

## Error Handling & Retries

* Configure retries in `playwright.config.ts` for flaky tests.
* Use try/catch blocks and proper assertions.

---

## Best Practices

* Keep tests isolated and independent.
* Use POM to separate UI logic.
* Avoid hard waits; prefer Playwright's wait mechanisms.
* Use environment variables for sensitive data.
* Write meaningful test titles and comments.
* Maintain updated dependencies.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Run `npx playwright install` if browsers are missing.
* Check `.env` variables.
* Run tests with `--debug` flag.
* Use Playwright trace viewer for in-depth debugging.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

* Follow code style and lint rules.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Add tests for new features.
* Open pull requests for review.
